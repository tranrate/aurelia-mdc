# aurelia-mdc
Material Design Components for the Aurelia framework.

This is an initial implementation of a set of Aurelia (http://aurelia.io/index.html) Custom Attributes for MDC. Each of the javascript components of MDC has a custom attribute which links to the Foundation of the Component replacing the MDC Adapter.

Material Design Components (https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) is a 'preview' alpha release at the moment. It is designed to integrate easily with frameworks such as Aurelia.
 
This version of Aurelia-mdc is an initial taster which is based on the Aurelia skeleton-esnext-webpack. Currently it is a single page application which demonstrates each of the components as an initial test.

Aurelia-mdc is under active development. In addition to further testing and enhancing, the next steps are:
  1. Write a global static class incorporating initial configuration and common functions.
  2. Produce a Demonstration system based on the MDC demo (https://material-components-web.appspot.com) and also incorporating (parts of) the Aurelia Demo.
  3. Package the system as an Aurelia PlugIn.
  4. Add additional components as the MDC project releases them.
  
Any comments, bug reports, inputs, offers of assistance etc. are welcome. MDC has the potential to integate well with Aurelia and offer an excellent Material Design based UI for Aurelia, developed by the community for the community.
