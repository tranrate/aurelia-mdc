The initial aim is to provide a good, efficient and glitch free interface between Aurelia and MDC. Custom Attributes are used
because they allow that. It also allows the developer to retain the full power of Aurelia and MDC, in particular the developer 
has full access to the html to use Aurelia's bindings etc. and do things "the Aurelia way".

Additionally I've tried to allow things to be done "the MDC way". The HTML used requires minimal alteration from (for example) 
the HTML used in the MDC documentation and Demo - the only change is to insert the custom attributes with the API bindings.

However I also see the need for a higher level interface, built on top of this and have a number of ideas about this.
